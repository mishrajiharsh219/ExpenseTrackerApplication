## 🚀 Features

- **Authentication** – Secure login & signup with JWT tokenization.
- **Expense Management** – Add/remove and categorize expenses.
- **Reports & Analytics** – Weekly, monthly, and yearly insights.
- **Interactive Dashboard** – Visual statistics of your spending habits.

---

## 📌 Non-Functional Requirements

- **Latency < 100ms** for a seamless user experience.
- **Fault Tolerant & Scalable** via Kubernetes & Docker.
- **Config-Driven** design to reduce future code changes.
- **Asynchronous Communication** using RabbitMQ & Kafka.

---

## 🏗 Architecture

- **Client** – Web/Mobile interface.
- **API Gateway (Kong)** – Manages authentication, routing & throttling.
- **Auth Service** – User authentication, signup, login & token management.
- **User Service** – User profile & preferences management.
- **Billing & Ledger Services** – Expense tracking & financial records.
- **Reporting Service** – Generates analytical reports.
- **Notification Service** – WhatsApp/SMS alerts via RabbitMQ.
- **Templatisation Service** – Report and notification template management.
- **Datastore & Redis** – Persistent storage & caching.

---

## 🕣 Future Scope

- **AI-Powered Insights** – Personalized financial advice.
- **Automated Expense Entry** – SMS parsing to auto-add expenses (with permission).
- **Proactive Alerts** – Risk, overspending, and budget notifications.

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Java Spring Boot (Microservices)
- **Gateway:** Kong API Gateway  
- **Messaging:** RabbitMQ, Kafka  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL / MySQL  
- **Caching:** Redis  
- **Containers:** Docker  
- **Orchestration:** Kubernetes  

---

## 📈 How It Works

1. **User authentication** via API Gateway → Auth Service issues JWT tokens.
2. **Expense operations** handled by Billing & Ledger Services.
3. **Reports & statistics** generated by Reporting Service.
4. **Notifications** sent asynchronously by Notification Service.
5. **System scaling & fault tolerance** managed by Kubernetes.
